### SOLID

#### Single Responsability Principle

May 20, 2020
A class should have only one job. That doesn't mean a function for each class.It's bigger than that. For instance, the banker should be the banker, the doctor should be the doctor. If we try to mix some functios it could be a disaster.

#### Opened - Close Principle

May 20, 2020

A class you should do it in a way that anyone else can easily build on to it, but not change it's core elements. For example, if you are cooking sushi, anyone else can prepare it differently, but no one can replace rice with flour or something else because it is no longer sushi.
